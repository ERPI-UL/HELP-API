    Ionic_Class: "Surfactant nature, which is mainly ionic or nonionic. Ionic surfactants depend strongly on the electrical characteristics of surfaces, which in turn depend on the electrolyte concentration and pH of the aqueous phase. nonionic surfactants depend on the specific characteristics of the surfactant molecule and its relation to the emulsion phases. Their effectiveness increases as the interfacial thickness increases and when they are in good solvent conditions. They are less sensible to pH and electrolyte concentration than ionic surfactants",
